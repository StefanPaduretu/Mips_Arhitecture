# Mips_Arhitecture
A MIPS processor is a type of RISC processor known for its simple, efficient instruction set, high performance, and use in embedded systems and gaming consoles. 
A functional MIPS processor has been created. The implementation was done in Xilinx ISE using VHDL Modules, while the simulation took part in ModelSim XE
